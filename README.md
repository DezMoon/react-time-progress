# React Time and Progress

## Description

This is a simple React application that allows users to input a specific time and see the progress of the day represented as a percentage. The application calculates how much of the day has passed based on the user-entered time and displays it next to the time input.

## Features

- **Time Input**: Allows users to input a specific time (hours and minutes) using an HTML5 time input field.
- **Progress Display**: Shows a percentage indicating how much of the day has passed based on the input time.

## Requirements

- **Node.js**: Ensure you have Node.js installed. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dezmoon/react-time-progress.git
   cd react-time-progress
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The application will open in your default web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

1. Enter a specific time in the input field (format: HH:MM).
2. The progress percentage representing how much of the day has passed will be displayed next to the input field.

## Code Overview

### `App.js`

- **State Management**: Uses React's `useState` to manage the time input and progress percentage.
- **Event Handling**: Updates the progress percentage based on user input using `handleTimeChange` function.

### `App.css`

- Basic styling for the application. (You can modify this to fit your design needs.)
